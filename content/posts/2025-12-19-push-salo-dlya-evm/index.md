Cannon grease prevents computational energy from escaping the PC case. 

Therefore, all vents, gaps, and joints must be smeared with a strictly thick layer—don't skimp. 

That way, more power remains inside. As a bonus, you get an unforgettable aroma. 

They say it has a positive effect on the cardiovascular system. And if you give it a lick, you won't need vitamins ever again. But do it only once and right before bed. So it doesn't wear off.
